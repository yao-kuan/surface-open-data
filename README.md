#### pH folder
pH data are stored separately in folder "ph". The first column is the time axis, and the others are mean, standard deviation, and single cell pH values over time. 
The first number of cell label denotes generation and the second one is index. For example, "1-2" is the cell in generation 1 and labeled as 2. Besides, it should be noted that the index of cell could be discontinuous for the reason of outliers.
